# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python with Tkinter

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. This allows two players to take turns playing the game on a 3x3 game board.


## How to Play

1. Ensure you have Python and Tkinter installed.
   
2. The game window will appear, and two players can take turns by clicking on the game board squares.

3. The game will automatically detect when one of the players wins or when the game results in a draw.

4. To start a new game, click the "Reset" button.

## Game Rules

- Player 'X' goes first.
- Players take turns by clicking on an empty square to place their symbol (either 'X' or 'O').
- The game ends when a player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- If all squares are filled, and no player wins, the game is declared a draw.

## Customization

You can customize the game's appearance and behavior by modifying the Python script. For example, you can change fonts, colors, or add more advanced features to the game.
